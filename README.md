# sprinklerPi_node
Raspberry Pi Sprinkler controller running on NodeJS.
This project is based on https://github.com/rszimm/sprinklers_pi, which works awesomely, but the Weather Underground integration is inconsistent. This is because it only allows the use of a static IP address for the API endpoint. 

I decided to tackle the weather adjustments in Javascript and thus will build the project in NodeJS.
